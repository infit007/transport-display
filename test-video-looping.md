# Video Looping Test Guide

## ✅ Enhanced Video Looping Features

I've improved the video looping functionality with multiple safety mechanisms:

### **🔄 Looping Mechanisms:**

1. **Primary**: `onEnded` event - triggers when video naturally ends
2. **Safety**: `timeupdate` event - triggers when video is 0.1s from end
3. **Fallback**: `stalled`/`suspend` events - triggers when video gets stuck
4. **Ultimate**: 60-second timeout - prevents infinite hanging

### **📝 Enhanced Logging:**

The console now shows detailed information:
- `🔄 Advancing playlist: 0 -> 1 (3 total items)`
- `📺 Current video: Video A`
- `📺 Next video: Video B`
- `🎬 Video ended, advancing to next`
- `▶️ Video can play: Video A (30.5s)`

### **🧪 How to Test:**

1. **Push multiple videos** to a bus using the admin panel:
   - Select 2-3 different video files
   - Click "Replace Media on Selected Buses"

2. **Watch the TV display** and check the browser console:
   - Videos should play in sequence
   - When a video ends, it should automatically advance to the next
   - After the last video, it should loop back to the first

3. **Expected behavior:**
   ```
   Video 1 plays → Video 1 ends → Video 2 plays → Video 2 ends → Video 3 plays → Video 3 ends → Video 1 plays (loops)
   ```

### **🔍 Debug Information:**

Check the browser console for these messages:
- ✅ `🔄 Advancing playlist: X -> Y (Z total items)`
- ✅ `🎬 Video ended, advancing to next`
- ✅ `▶️ Video can play: [Video Name] ([duration]s)`

If you see issues:
- ❌ `⚠️ Video near end, advancing as safety measure`
- ❌ `⚠️ Video stalled, advancing as safety measure`
- ❌ `⏰ Video safety timeout reached, advancing playlist`

### **🚀 Test Steps:**

1. **Open admin panel** → News Feeds
2. **Select a bus** (e.g., UK-05-H-8001)
3. **Select 2-3 video files** from the media list
4. **Click "Replace Media on Selected Buses"**
5. **Watch TV display** - should show continuous looping
6. **Check console logs** for advancement messages

### **💡 Troubleshooting:**

If videos still don't loop:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify video files are valid and playable
3. Check network connectivity
4. Ensure backend is running and media is assigned

The enhanced system should now provide reliable continuous video looping! 🎉
